# This software sieves for near-repdigit (NRD) primes base 10 commonly of the form  10000000000...000001(both + and -)

Written entirely in standard C and works for both 32 and 64 bit compilations although 64 bit compilation is much faster

This software would be greatly improved if the Jacobi symbol math could be integrated but no algorithms have been shared at this time

The multitasking library is entirely self created and fully   libpthread compliant.
